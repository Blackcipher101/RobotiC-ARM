# RobotiC-ARM :mechanical_arm:
Ever seen arms in huge plants:factory:? Yes this is something like that which we a robotic manipulator in techincal terms and if I want to get more techical which I love(coz I brag :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) that is
its a 3DOF robot which basically means it has three joints which can move independently of each other something similar to human arm a revolute joint followed by a continous joint and another continous joint.
